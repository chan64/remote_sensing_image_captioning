# Remote Sensing Image Captioning
Remote sensing Image Captioning is a special case of Image Captioning which solves the difficulties in processing the remote sensing images. Issues may arise due to translation, rotation and viewpoint of images and maintaining semantic consistency in the generated captions. This method of describing a remote sensing scene in the form of sentences plays an important role in a number of fields, such as image retrieval, scene classification and as a vision companion. A Domain-driven approach is developed, in which the domain probabilities are used for captioning the remote sensing images. This approach concentrates on the domain- based information available in the images. A new dataset, called UAVIC dataset is created for images captured using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which covers wide range of land having multiple terrains and gives a better view of the landscapes. The proposed domain driven approach is applied to UCM and UAVIC dataset and the quality of resulting captions are evaluated using BLEU scores.
